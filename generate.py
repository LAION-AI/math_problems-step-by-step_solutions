["We are given a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse 'h' measuring 22.04 units and one side 'a' measuring 16.576 units. We're looking to find the length of the other side.\nThe initial step calls upon the Pythagorean theorem. The square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. We'll alter this theorem to find the length of the missing side.\nWhen we apply this revised theorem, we get 22.04^2 - 16.576^2 = missing side^2.\nWe now take the square root of both sides of the equation to get missing side = sqrt(22.04^2 - 16.576^2).\nTherefore, the length of the missing side is roughly 14.526 units."]
