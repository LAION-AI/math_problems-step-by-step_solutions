age_problem :  ["The age difference between Sarah and Asaf's age is half the total number of pencils Sarah has. The sum of their ages is 115, and Sarah is 38 years old. If Asaf has 60 more pencils than Sarah, calculate the total number of pencils they have together.\nSolution: If the sum of their ages is 115, and Sarah is 38 years old, Asaf is 77 years old.\nThe age difference between Sarah and Asaf's age is 77-38 = 39.\nSince the age difference between Sarah and Asaf's age is half the total number of pencils Sarah has, Sarah has 2*39 = 78 pencils.\nIf Asaf has 60 more pencils than Sarah, Asaf has 78+60= 138 pencils.\nTogether, they have 78 + 138 = 216 pencils."]
